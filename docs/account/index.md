# Account

With an account, you can create multiple counters and synchronize them in real time among multiple devices when online. This also gives you an online backup in case you should experience data loss on your phone. You can log in to the [Web App](https://malamode.io/demo){: target="malamode"} and view your counts, or restore to a new MalaMode installation on your device by logging in.

If you have an account but have forgotton your password, [reset your password here.](https://malamode.io/forgotpassword/).

## How do I register for an account?

Touch *Register* in the top right of the Navigation bar. If you don't already have *Premium Service*,  you will need to upgrade: Touch *Buy* to purchase. Once your purchase is approved by the App Store or Play Store, the screen will change to the Register screen, where you can sign up with your email and password. Please type your email carefully---we currently do not verify emails, so if you have mistyped it, you may not be able to log in and/or reset your password in the future.

If you have purchased premium service before, you probably already have an account, so you should just log in with that account, using the *Login* button at the top left of the Navigation bar. If not, you can register by touching *Restore previous purchase*.

If you have a small phone and the text is jumbled on the Register screen, you may have *Large Accessbility Sizes* turned on. Go to your phone's Settings/General/Accessibility and turn it off, at least while you are purchasing premium service.
