# Target Mode
If you need to accumulate a certain count by a certain date, MalaMode can calculate a daily rate and display the countdown to your daily goal. Turn on *Target Mode* in *Settings*, enter your total *Target Count*, and the *Target Date* on which you need to finish your accumulation (inclusive). You can also set a signal, either a Sound or Vibration, to notify you when you reach your daily goal. When you open the counter each day, your daily goal will display in parentheses: (108) and will decrement with each count. If you continue counting after you reach the daily goal, the parentheses will disappear and the count will preceded by a plus sign: +100. When you do extra (or less than) your goal for a day, your new total will be taken into account when the daily goal is calculated for the following day.
You can turn on both Mala Mode and Target Mode at the same time if you want to keep track of how many rounds you are doing. Target Mode has priority on the main counting display, so you can see your progress towards your daily goal, but you can view rounds information in the History tab. If you have signals set in both Target Mode and Mala Mode, that could be confusing, so you might be best served by turning off signals in Mala Mode. But if you want, you could set it up so that a Vibrate signal indicates you've finished a Mala round, and a Bell indicates you've reached your daily goal, for example.
 
It may happen that when you open Malamode for the first time on a new day, you may see the same number displayed as was shown as your progress towards your goal the day before. In this case, Malamode needs to be refreshed to realize it is a new day. The easiest way to do this is simply to switch counters, and this would be the natural way to do it if you are rotating between several counters each day. If you only have one counter, though, you can go to *Settings/Target Mode* (you don't need to change anything on that screen-- just go back to the counter). Or you can kill MalaMode and relaunch it. Or on Android you might be able to touch the Back button, then reselect the app from the app switcher. 

If you use MalaMode on more than one device, be aware that although the total count is synchronized between devices as usual, the starting point of your daily accumulation is not. So if you open your counter on a second device after you've started your daily accumulation, the daily countdown will not be correct on that device. It will remain synchronized though if you open the counter on both devices before you start the daily accumulation.
