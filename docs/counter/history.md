# Count History 

The History screen shows the last few dozen events accumulated on the device. When *Mala Mode* (two words, meaning the mode, not the app), is turned on, you can choose to show either  Rounds history, or  Count history. If you're looking at Count history, you can delete any event by swiping to the left and touching the *delete* button, and the amount accumulated by that event will be subtracted from the counter.  You cannot delete Rounds, and the rounds history will not be changed when you delete counts. That means the Rounds history will not be correct until you complete more rounds.

Note that counts or rounds accumulated on other devices do not typically show in History, although a *Sync* event may appear when the current device is brought online and counts from another device are synchronized.
