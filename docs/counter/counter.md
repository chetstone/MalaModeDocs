# Counter

When the app is started, the Counter screen is already selected in the Tab bar. Simply touch anywhere on the main screen to count&mdash;the whole screen between the Navigation and Tab bars is the button. This
makes it easy to count without looking at the device.

## Options to improve focus
When counting, you may want more security against unwanted operations 
(for example, if you are counting while walking).  For this, you can:

* [Lock the Main Counter Button]({{site_url}}/docs/counter/settings/#LockCounter)
so that an accidental tap on the Navigation bar or  Tab bar will not have any effect.
* [Keep App Awake]({{site_url}}/docs/counter/settings/#KeepAwake) to keep the phone from going to sleep.
* [Lock in Portrait]({{site_url}}/docs/counter/settings/#LockPortrait) to the phone from switching to landscape mode when it is rotated.

## Other options

There many ways to customize your counter by selecting the [Settings]({{site_url}}/docs/counter/settings) tab in the Tab bar. You can, for example:

* Set the increment  by which the counter advances  with each press
* Add or subtract an arbitrary amount to the total
* Set a background image
* Set a sound to play or vibrate the phone at each count
* Emulate a mala with [Mala Mode]({{site_url}}/docs/counter/mala-mode)
* Keep track of progress towards a goal with [Target Mode]({{site_url}}/docs/counter/target-mode)
* Share your accumulations by email

## Counting FAQs

### I'm very attached to my mala---I don't want to give it up!
That's understandable. That's why we designed *MalaMode* to serve as a mala accessory as well as a primary counter. You can use your mala for your primary counts, and just use *MalaMode* to keep track of the number of rounds you have done. You might want to set your [counting increment]({{site_url}}/docs/counter/settings/#increment) to the length of your mala (e.g. 108), and use [Mala Mode]({{site_url}}/docs/counter/mala-mode) to display the number of rounds. Or just simply count rounds.

### What if I don't want my phone near me while meditating?

Well, we can't help you there but we totally get it! Phones are very distracting. But there are some things you can do to mitigate. First, make sure you turn on Do Not Disturb, or turn off all Notifications in some other way. Also, consider getting a dedicated device just to run MalaMode. The iPhone 4s runs MalaMode very well on iOS 9.3.6. It is much smaller than modern phones, fits nicely in the palm of your hand, and with  its award-winning design of a sandwich of two smooth glass plates, it feels really nice. You can get one for around $20 on ebay. You don't even need an unlocked phone, since you're not going to be using it as a phone&mdash;just connect it to your wifi.

### I accidentally pressed the counter twice!

Of course in most cases, the best way to recover from double count is to simply recite another mantra without pressing the counter.  But you also have the option of switching to the History tab and deleting the latest count there. (If you have *Mala Mode* turned on, make sure you're displaying Count history, not Rounds as described [here]({{site_url}}/docs/counter/history). Just swipe to the left and hit delete. That count will be subtracted from the total.

### Can I use MalaMode Online? Offline?

The iOS and Android apps, if you are logged into your account, synchronize your counts between different devices via the cloud when you are online, but are also reliable for use for an extended time offline: they will syncronize whenever they are reconnected to the internet. But if you're not logged in to an account, it doesn't matter whether you are online or offline --- the data is stored reliably in the device's filesystem.
