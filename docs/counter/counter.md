# Counter

Simply touch anywhere on the main screen to count&mdash;the whole screen is the button. This
makes it easy to count without looking at the device.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }


To provide even more security against unwanted operations while counting
(for example, if you are counting while walking), you can [lock the button]('../settings')
so that an accidental tap on the navigation bar or tab bar will not have any effect.
