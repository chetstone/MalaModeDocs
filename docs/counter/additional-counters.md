# Additional Counters

If you have subscribed to *Premium Service* with an In-App Purchase, and have created and logged in to an [account]({{site_url}}/docs/account),  you can have as many counters as you like.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Choosing a counter
Switching between counters is done with the controls on the Navigation bar. You can move forwards and backwards in the list of counters with the arrows, and you can touch the current counter name in the center of the Navigation bar to bring up the entire list, where you can choose whichever counter you desire.



## Adding a new counter

Bring up the list of counters by touching the current counter name in the center of the Navigation bar. Touch the *Edit* button on the top right, then the *+* in the same place. Type the name of the new counter, then touch *Return* (iOS) or *Done* (Android) on the keyboard.

## Deleting a counter
You cannot delete the current counter, so first switch to any other counter, then touch its name in the Navigation bar to bring up the counter list. Then, on iOS, swipe the counter name you want to delete from right to left, and hit the red *Delete* button that appears. On Android, touch *Edit* first, then swipe and touch *Delete*.

## Renaming a counter
You can rename the current counter in [Settings]({{site_url}}/docs/counter/settings/#name).

## Reordering counters
Since you can easily move backwards and forwards in the counter list using the arrow buttons in the Navigation bar, it is useful to be able to change the order of list. Bring up the counter list as described above,  touch *Edit*, then you can drag the counters up and down in the list. On iOS, touch and drag using the drag handles on the right. On Android, you can touch and drag anywhere in the item.
