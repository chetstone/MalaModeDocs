# Mala Mode

*MalaMode* has special features to emulate a mala.  To use it, turn on *Mala Mode* in Settings, set the length of mala you want, and choose how and whether you want to be notified when you have reached the end of the mala: by vibration and/or by a sound. If you have a sound set for each count, you can select a different sound for mala completion.

Then choose whether you want the count to *Reset* at the end of each round.  Turn on *Reset* if you just want to do rounds and don't need to keep track of your total accumulation. The counter will reset to zero each time you've completed a round.

If *Reset* is off, the total number of rounds you have accumulated will be displayed, followed by the number of partial counts in the next round, separated by a colon **(:)**. For example, if you have selected a Mala length of 108, and you have completed 1081 counts, the display will read **10:1** (ten rounds plus one count). This is useful for example if you're accumulating for Ngondro. Generally when the requirement is 100,000 prostrations, you're actually supposed to do 108,000, or 1000 rounds of 108.  Mala mode handles the math for you by counting rounds.
