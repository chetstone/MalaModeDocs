Time your meditations
## Duration
When the Timer tab is selected (the left-most entry in the Tab bar at the bottom of the screen), the Timer setup screen is displayed. Initially the countdown time is set to 30 minutes. If you want to change this, touch the *Set Duration* button below the large time display. If you have not already bought the *Timer* in-app purchase, a page will come up where you can complete your purchase. After that, when you touch *Set Duration*, you can set the countdown time anywhere from 1 minute to 24 hours.

## Bells
After setting the Duration, you can choose Starting, Ending and Interval bells. You have a number of bell sounds to choose from, and can set relative volume for each bell (the phone's main volume controls also affect the overall volume). You can choose to have the bell repeat twice or three times if you like.

### Intervals
An Interval bell is a bell that rings sometime between the Start and End of the session. Touch *Intervals* and you'll see a list of the intervals you have set up and a button to Add an Interval.


To delete an interval, just swipe it to the left in the list and touch the red *Delete* button.

You can program as many Interval bells as you like. At the top of the *Add Interval* screen you choose from the following types:

**Start**
:This programs a bell to sound a certain amount of time after your session is started. Use the *Time after start* slider to program when it will sound.

**Repeat**
:To have the sound repeat at regular intervals during the session. Touch *Repetition Interval* to set the amount of time between each bell.

**Random**
:A bell to sound randomly. Use the slider to select how many times you want it to sound during the session. The randomness is constrained a bit to prevent bells from sounding too close to each other.

**End**
:Set a bell to sound at a time relative to the end of the session. Touch *Time before end* to choose the amount of time before the end you want it to ring.

Once you have chosen the type and frequency, set the bell sound and volume you want.

## Starting the session
A summary of your chosen  bells appears on the Setup screen. Press the *Start* button to start your session. You can pause and resume the session at any time. If you should momentarily switch to another app, the timer will continue counting down and interval bells will play in the background.

## Timer Options
Touching the menu icon <span class="material-icons">menu</span> at the top left of the Navigation bar when you're on the Timer Setup screen will open a drawer with several options.

### Sessions
#### Accumulated Time
This item  displays the total time of all your sessions. Touching that option, you can choose the dates you want the accumulator to include, and enter an additional time. You would enter additional time, for instance if you wanted to include  time you had kept track of in another way before starting to use MalaMode Timer.

#### Session Log
Lists all your sessions. To delete a session, just swipe it to the left and press the red *Delete* button.

If you have purchased *Premium Service* in-app and are logged in to your account, your session logs will be stored on our cloud service and synchronized between all your devices. Note that this will create a backup of your logs in case you ever experience data loss on your device.

#### Add Session
For entering a session manually without running the timer. You might use this if, for example, you had to end a session early and forgot to stop the timer, so the session was logged with an incorrect time. You can delete that session and add it in manually with the correct time.

### Themes
You can choose from several color themes for the timer.;

## Timer Presets
Save your current counter settings by touching the icon
<span class="material-icons">playlist_add</span>
in the top right of the Navigation bar and entering a name for your preset. To use a preset, touch the name of the current preset in the title bar and choose your new one. To delete a preset, touch the preset name in the title bar and swipe right-to-left on the preset you want to delete and select the red *Delete* button. If you have *Premium Service* and are logged in to your account, your presets are saved in the cloud and synchronized to all your devices.
